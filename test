\textbf{MovieLens-Tagging Dataset:} The MovieLens 10M Dataset is a movie rating and social tagging dataset. As this paper only considers binary relations, only the tagging assignment dataset (i.e., tags.dat file) were used in the experiments. The temporal information includes year, month, day information. The recommended items are movies. \footnote{\url{https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/}}.
